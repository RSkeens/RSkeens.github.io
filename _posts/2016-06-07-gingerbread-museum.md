Certain countries show large and extravagant welcome boards upon entry. If the VÃ¡clav Havel Airport's welcome mural for visitors is underwhelming then perhaps a visit to the Gingerbread Museum which is situated very close to the Prague Castle is in order.

The Gingerbread Museum is a hidden gem to experience which offers speciality handmade gingerbread delights. It should come as no surprise that many home bakers stop by for inspiration. The wide range of gifts on sale are unique and of a better quality than what can usually be purchased elsewhere.

Many tourists simply wander past, oblivious to the perfect end to their castle visit. Not to be missed!
