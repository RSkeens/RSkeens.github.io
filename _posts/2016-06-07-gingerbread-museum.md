Certain countries show a large and extravagant welcome board upon entry. If the VÃ¡clav Havel Airport's welcome mural for visitors is underwhelming then perhaps a visit to the Gingerbread Museum which is situated very close to the Prague Castle is in order.

The Gingerbread Museum is truly a hidden gem and offers speciality handmade gingerbread delights. It should come as no surprise that many home bakers stop by for inspiration. Their wide range of gifts on sale are unique and are of a better quality compared to the usual tourist shops.

Many tourists simply wander past, oblivious to a perfect end to their castle visit. Not to be missed!
